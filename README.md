# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set
Using EDA I have tried to explore Haberman's Survival Data Set. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

# Features used in the data set:
- Age
- Operation year
- Number of axillary lymph  nodes
# Class:
- Survived
- Died
# Objective:
- Predict whether a pateint died(within 5 years of operation) or survived(5 year or longer) after the operation.
