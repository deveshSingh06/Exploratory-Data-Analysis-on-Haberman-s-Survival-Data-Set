# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set
Haberman's Survival Data Set has been exploreed using EDA in this repository. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) ?
- It is a task of analyzing the given data using tools from Statistics, Linear Algebra, Plotting tools, etc.
- It is the very first thing to do before providing a model using machine learning.
- Here, we explore the given data as much as we can, hence the name Exploratory.

**Note**: While exploring the data one must also try to clean the data by using some data cleaning techniques such as deduplication, removing extra spaces, change text to the proper case, spell check, etc. To learn about some data cleaning and pre-processing techniques, check my notebook [here](https://github.com/deveshSingh06/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/2.%20Text%20Pre-Processing.ipynb).

## Features used in the data set:
- Age
- Operation year
- Number of axillary lymph  nodes
## Classes:
- Survived
- Died
## Objective:
- Predict whether a pateint died(within 5 years of operation) or survived(5 years or longer) after the operation.
## EDA on the data set has been applied using the following:
- Univariate Analysis
  - An analysis performed on a single variable(a unique feature) is known as a univariate analysis.
  - The following plots fall under the univariate analysis:
    - PDF(s)
    - CDF(s)
    - Box Plots
    - Violin Plots
- Bivariate Analysis
  - An analysis performed on two variable(two features) is known as a bivariate analysis.
  - The following plots fall under the univariate analysis:
    - Pair-Plots
    - Scatter Plots
