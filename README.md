# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set
Using EDA I have tried to explore Haberman's Survival Data Set. The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

## Features used in the data set:
- Age
- Operation year
- Number of axillary lymph  nodes
## Class:
- Survived
- Died
## Objective:
- Predict whether a pateint died(within 5 years of operation) or survived(5 years or longer) after the operation.
## EDA on the data set has been applied using the following:
- Univariate Analysis
  - An analysis performed on a single variable(a unique feature) is known as an univariate analysis.
  - The following plots fall under the univariate analysis:
   - PDF(s)
   - CDF(s)
   - Box Plots
   - Violin Plots
- Bivariate Analysis
 - An analysis performed on two variable(two features) is known as a bivariate analysis.
 - The following plots fall under the univariate analysis:
   - Pair-Plots
   - Scatter Plots
